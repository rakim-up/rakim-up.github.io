  <!--- neuroplasticity-->

<header>Rakim UP: blog/Cultural blogs/Neuroplasticity</header>
<h1 class="red-purple-text">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h1>
  <p>
    Understainding the principles of neuroplasticity has many benefits. The basis of the principles are like the idea of building rapport. When an action is practiced or a memory accessed repeatedly the neural networks that house them are then made stronger which then make the action or memory that much more effective and easy to access/display. In short you can adapt both structure and function of your brain through repitition and experience. 
  </p>
    
<h1 class="red-purple-text">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h1>
  <p>
    I have always had a hard time with being a morning person. The idea of neuroplasticity has made me believe that waking up early and being a morning person can be obtained, as long as I stay connsistent and keep those neural networks firing day in day out.

    Also with coding I plan to implement this idea with the harder to grasp concepts and wrestle with them untill they get easier.
  </p>
<h1 class="red-purple-text">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h1>
  <ul>
      <li>Memory tasks and games</li>

    <!--- growth mindset-->

<h1 class="red-purple-text">Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h1>
  <p>
    A growth mindset can be described as an ever evolving state of mind and being. What makes it relevant is that it signifys the ability and belief to develop your intelligence and skills over time.
  </p>
<h1 class="red-purple-text">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h1>
  <p>
    Yes, I realised that having this mindset is only the starting point and that consistent excecution on the continual development is just as important to the equation
  </p>
<h1 class="red-purple-text">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h1>
  <p>
    It is a good cushion of reassurance for me to know that where ever I may start from that with a growth mindset can help me out of any jam.

<h1 class="red-purple-text">Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h1>
  <p>
    Knowing that with consistent effort chipping away at something, and a belief that the intelligence or talent can be improved with dilligent work puts everything within arms reach of doing anything I want. I have found it personally makes things abit daunting but inspires hope at the same time.
