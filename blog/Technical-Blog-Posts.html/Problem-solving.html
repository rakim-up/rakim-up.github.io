<h1 class="red-purple-text">Discuss a time where you were blocked on a simple problem, and a time where you elegantly solved a problem</h1>
  <p>
   This weeks problem was that I got stuck motivating myself to actually work on things, and prioritizing in general. I just started reading something a new series I enjoy, and when I do start reading something captivating, I find it really easy to lose myself in whatever im reading at the time. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Although, it means I am now crunching things at the last minute once more, I dont feel too overwhelmed because I have had a list of things I have to finish day by day and it has held me accountable to the deadline so far (...so good...hopefully). Reflecting on this made me realise that it I put things off and do other things if im not too sure on the next step, and instead of reading for a few days and letting the content digest in the back of my head, I need to be more active with the implementation of the knowledge im trying to understand. In short it needs to turn from an abstract, philisophical thought to a "Oh, lemme muck around with it and see what happens"

<h1 class="red-purple-text">How comfortable are you with using and implementing each of these problem solving techniques and processes?</h1>
  <ul>
      <li class="red-purple-text">Pseudocode</li>
      <p> Psudeocode would give it a 6/10. Understand its utility and the why behind it but I dont think I could give you the worlds best psuedo code youve ever seen at this point.</p>
      <li class="red-purple-text">Trying something</li>
      <p>As stated above this is something I have to develop rather than leaving it to compile in the back of my head. 4/10.</p>
      <li class="red-purple-text">Rubber ducky method</li>
      <p> Yes this is a personal favourite, I do like this one and I use it on and off again so I would give myself an 8/10.</p>
      <li class="red-purple-text">Reading error messages</li>
      <p>5/10, although I use them sometimes I dont understand every message it spits out or what exactly to do with the message. I'm sure I will become better with more use, and thankfully it does push me on the right path and is useful</p>
      <li class="red-purple-text">Console.logging</li>
      <p> I need more work on this as Im not 100% sure right now honestly 5/10</p>
      <li class="red-purple-text">Googling</li>
      <p>Can be better, always room for improvement when trying to write specific things. 3/10</p>
      <li class="red-purple-text">Asking your peers for help</li>
      <p>Although I am not shy and have reached out, this is again something I have to work on more. 4/10</p>
      <li class="red-purple-text">Asking coaches for help</li>
      <p>4/10 as above.</p>
      <li class="red-purple-text">Improving your process with reflection</li>
      <p>4/10 that could as need some sharpening.</p>
  </ul>
