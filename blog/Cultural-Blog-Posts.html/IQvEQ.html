        <h1 class="red-purple-text">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also four domains of Emotional Intelligence — self awareness, self management, social awareness, and relationship management — each can help a leader face any crisis with lower levels of stress, less emotional reactivity and fewer unintended consequences.
        </p>

        <h1 class="red-purple-text">How is it different to IQ?</h1>
        <br>
          <p>
           
          IQ is used to determine academic abilities and identify individuals with off-the-chart intelligence or mental challenges. 

         </p> 

         <br>
         <h1 class="red-purple-text">Why is it important?</h1>
         <br>
          <p>
          EQ is a better indicator of success in the workplace and is used to identify leaders, good team players, and people who best work by themselves.
