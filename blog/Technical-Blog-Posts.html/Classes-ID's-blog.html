        <h3>What is a Class?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>A Class is a selector used to to define/group/target many elements at once. Here is an example of one:
        
        <p></p>
        
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>What is an ID?</h3>
        <br>
          <p>
          An ID is used to identify, style & format a singular element.   
         </p> 
          <p>
           ID tags can also be used to navigate through a webpage. Here is an example of one.
         </p>

         <h3>What are the best practices associated with using them?</h3>
         <br>
          <p>
            Use functional names, as it supports the structure and makes it easier to make adjustments/conceptualize.
          </p>

           <p> Keep the naming of the Elements as long as they need to be while simoultaneously making them as short as possible.

           </p>

            <p>Only use ID's if you want a style to apply to one element on the web page, and to use a class selector if you want to style many elements.</p>
