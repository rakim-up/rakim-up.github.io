<header>Rakim UP: about/ Learning Plan</header>

<h1>What is your long term goal or career pathway</h1>
  <p>Ideally I would like to have a career that is remote, where I can make cool stuff all day.</p>
<br>

<h1>A description of your strengths/Limitations when learning</h1>
  <p>I learn best when someone can show me how to do something, we can talk through whats going on, why? etc. And then they let me have a go myself while answering questions and ideally only helping when I am really stuck.</p>
  <p>My biggest limitation at the moment is that I am finding it hard sitting down for a long period of time. I've not been in an environment like this, especially with free reign of the time and pace I work at and its a bit challenging staying focused at times. </p>

<h1>What skills(non-technical-human skills) would you like to see developed while at Dev Academy? </h1>
  <p>I would like to be a better listener and team player. I always think I have a way to do something but as the old saying goes: "there more than one way to skin a cat" and I acknowledge my way isnt always the best way. I would like to explore new perspectives and understand the why of my team members, and the how.</p>
<br>

<h1> A commitment to how you will manage your workload this programme, this should include:</h1>    
<h1> An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</h1>
  <p>Try to follow time boxes, use toggle and keep my self accountable.</p>
<h1>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h1>
  <p>Break them into smaller problems and start chipping away. "there's no time like now to start!"</p>
<br>

<h1>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h1>
  <p>I will do my own looking about, but If that turns into a dead end I wont be shy to reach out to the likes of Gerard and the online Discord.</p>
<br>

<h1>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h1>
  <p>All I ask for is a fair go like everyone else. And a bit of patience, I do have a tendency to forget and misplace things.</p>
