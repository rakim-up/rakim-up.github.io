<h1>What is your long term goal or career pathway</h1>
<p>
Ideally I would like to have a career that is remote, has a geat work-life balance and culture.
</p>
<br>
<h1>
  A description of your strengths/Limitations when learning
</h1>
  <p>
I learn best when someone can show me how to do something, we can talk through whats going on, why? etc. And then they let me have a go myself while answering questions and ideally only helping when I am really stuck.
  </p>
<h1>
  What skills(non-technical-human skills) would you like to see developed while at Dev Academy? 
</h1>
  <p>
I would like to be a better listener and team player. I always think I have a way to do something but as the old saying goes: "there more than one way to skin a cat" and I acknowledge my way isnt always the best way. I would like to explore new perspectives and understand the why of my team members, and the how.
  </p>
  <br>
<h1> 
   A commitment to how you will manage your workload this programme, this should include:
</h1>    
<h2>
  An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
</h2>
  <p>
Try to follow time boxes, use toggl and keep my self accountable.
  </p>
<h2>
  What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
</h2>
  <p>
Break them into smaller problems and start chipping away. "there's no time like now to start!"
  </p>
  <br>
  <h1>
    A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
  </h1>
    <p>
      I will do my own looking about, but If that turns into a dead end I wont be shy to reach out to the likes of Gerard and the online Discord.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>
      A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
    </h1>
      <p>
    All I ask for is a fair go like everyone else. And a bit of patience, I do stupidly have a tendency to forget things.
      </p>
      <br>
    <h1>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h1>
    <p>
      Ummm, none that I know of so far.
