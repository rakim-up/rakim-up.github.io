  Rakim UP: about/Identity & Values
</header>

<p>
  My personal top five things I value are family, friends, sleep, clarity, excercise and health (spiritually, mentally and physically). </p>
<p>
I know there is 9 above.. but oh well..
</p>

<h1 class="red-purple-text">Explain a situation where you've had an ethical descion to make</h1>
<p>
  At the end of the term 2/2022, at one of the basketball clubs I coach at we had an end of the term "tournament week". This usually means for our session kids will start with a quick 10 minute warm up, then get split into teams to play against eachother for the remainder of the session.
</p>
<p>
  On that day there were 4 coaches present and we each had about 8 kids each during that session. The kids were ranged between year 8 - year 13. This particular team that I was given had only 2 upperclassmen (Year 12-13) whilst the other 3 teams bolstered about 4 each. So off the bat I was put at a cross-road where 1) I could play the older more developed kids every game the whole game or 2) I could rotate the beginners on regularly even if it means we will probably fail to get off the bottom court and win a game.
</p>
<p>
  I put being a fair, inclusive coach above being a winning coach that day and rotated all kids into the game only pulling them off when they were tired. Basically all kids could stay on the court as long as they were giving their best effort on both sides of the ball: Offense and Defense. This ensured not only ample play time for all my younger kids but more importantly it cemented the idea of effort above competency. Also, just as importantly it gave my older kids a chance to be put into leadership positions amongst their peers by 1) being better communicators 2) an opportunity to lead by example 3) an environment to thrive.
</p>
 <p>
  In the end we won our last game out of the 6 we played. I couldnt be more proud of my boys and girls.
</p> 

<h1 class="red-purple-text">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and Identity</h1>

<p>
  I have two sides of family who are polar opposites in  character traits but by being Maori/Samoan the underlying values of family (mainly) are roughly about the same.
</p>
<p>
  On one side of my family all of them have some kind of artistic or academic inclination: Musicians, Painters, Play Writes, Directors, Producers, Proffessors. While on the other side, all of them are more inclined practically: Tradesmen, Makers, Farmers of all sorts, Hunters, Gatherers, Athletes. I also strongly believe that they're both extreme cases in both character traits.  
</p>
<p>
  This kind of duality has heavily influenced my Identity growing up as to where I am at ease and confident in most environments doing most things. I may not be the best right away, but with a well rounded character, humility and time I know there will be countless iterations of improvement to look forward to.
</p>
<p>
  I value my fortunate upbringing, and I am grateful for the person I am because of them.
