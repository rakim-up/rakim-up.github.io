What is your long term goal or career pathway?

Ideally, in the short to mid term I would like to have a job where I could work remotely with a healthy work life balance. In the long term I would like to ensure that this kind of work is more synonymous and normalised with being Polynesian.


A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning.

Strengths:
I am a strong visual and practical learner. If I see someone do something and they can talk me through what they're doing while doing it, I believe I will be able to retain most information during the first walkthrough.
And with some trial and error by myself and minimal guidance I know it wont be long before I grasp most concepts and will be able to implement them.

Limitations:
I have some struggles with keeping myself accountable with the time frames and time boxes given during the excersises. 


What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

I would like to see myself step out of my shell abit and express myself more unreserved. 

A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives

Its normal to be socio centric as I am very famnily orientated and have been playing/leading in team sports my whole life. I only know how to be a productive, supportive, inclusive member of a unit, and I will always try my best to not let my team down, 

What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you

I try be practical and make big problems small, manageable and work at them one by one.

A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way

I always ask for help if I need it and wont be shy. I know that its a struggle to be completely self sufficient this early on in the journey and I cannot/will not hinder my progress by being shy.

A description of what you expect from the facilitation team

A fair go and to be treated like everyone else is all I ask.

Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.

These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should arrange them together so that you feel they are clearly communicated.
